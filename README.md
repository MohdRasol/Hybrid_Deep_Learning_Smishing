## üîç Overview

Arabic smishing (SMS phishing) attacks leverage linguistic ambiguity to bypass traditional spam filters. This project implements a **CNN-BiGRU hybrid deep learning model**, optimized for Arabic's morphological complexity, using domain-specific preprocessing and Word2Vec embeddings.

Key features:
- Tailored preprocessing for Arabic (diacritics removal, Farasa tokenization)
- Hybrid CNN-BiGRU architecture with attention
- LIME-based interpretability
- Evaluation using ROC, confusion matrix, and cross-validation
